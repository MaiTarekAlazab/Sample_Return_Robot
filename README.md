This Project introduces an autonomous sample return
robot. It was inspired by one of NASA Centennial
challenges (Sample Return Robot Category). The mission
of the robot is to navigate autonomously through an
unknown environment and identify some pre-defined
samples then, return them back to the base or the start
position. The mechanical complexity of a Mars rover
introduced a big problem regarding the budget, building
time and number of team members so, the project was
focused on the high-level robot programing problem and
introduced a simple four-wheel driven rover that perform
the same mission but, in an indoor environment.
The project is based on Robot Operating System
(ROS), which make it easier to reproduce, modify and
improve. Also, Modularity and readable codes were
considered during the design and implementation of the
robot software for the sake of replication and
modification.
